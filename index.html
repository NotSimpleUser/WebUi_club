                    <p>Los Angeles Lakers, American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers are one of the most successful and popular professional franchises in all American sports.
                    The team moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1947, 
                    and its name was changed to the Lakers to reflect the Minnesota state nickname, 
                    “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” That same year the Lakers acquired George Mikan, who became professional basketball’s 
                    first dominant “big man” and the first in a series of great Laker centres. The Lakers joined the BAA (the official precursor of the NBA) for 
                    the 1948–49 season and won the final BAA championship. The NBA was formed in 1949, and Mikan and the Lakers—which also featured future Hall of Famers 
                    Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, Vern Mikkelsen, and (from 1953) Clyde Lovellette—won four of the first five league titles, establishing professional basketball’s
                    first dynasty.</p>
